# Advent of Code 2023

I'll probably get bored of this before I finish it, but in the meantime this
is where I'll be keeping my solutions for [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

## Usage

1. [install go 1.21](https://go.dev/dl/)
2. clone this repo
3. run the tests `go test -v ./...`

## Comic

The reddit user [fish-n-chips-uk](https://www.reddit.com/user/fish-n-chips-uk/) is
creating a comic to go with the event. It's pretty cool.
